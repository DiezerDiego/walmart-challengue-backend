# üöÄ Spring Boot Project ‚Äì Best Practices & Architecture

## ‚úÖ Architecture Strategy
For **small projects**, use a **Layered Architecture**: `Controller` (handles HTTP requests), `Service` (contains business logic), `Repository` (interacts with the database), `DTO` (data transfer objects), `Entity` (JPA models), and `Mapper` (manual or with MapStruct). This structure is simple and easy to maintain for small to medium applications.  
For **medium to large projects**, consider using **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** to decouple business logic from infrastructure. Organize your code into `domain` (models, interfaces), `application` (use cases), `adapters/in` (controllers), `adapters/out` (repositories, external APIs), `infrastructure` (configurations), and `config` (Spring config and beans). This approach improves testability and long-term maintainability.

## üîê Security
Implement **Spring Security** with JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization. Encrypt passwords using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`. Define protected routes and roles, e.g., `/api/admin/**` for admin users. Store sensitive config like secrets and tokens in **Azure Key Vault**, and avoid hardcoded credentials.

## üßæ Global Exception Handling
Use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions globally. Return a consistent error structure with HTTP status, timestamp, error message, and request path. This improves API usability and debugging.

## üîê Data Encryption
Use `BCrypt` for password hashing. For encrypting sensitive fields (e.g., documents or tokens), use the Java Cryptography API (`javax.crypto`). Never commit raw secrets or keys in the repository. Always externalize them via environment variables or Azure Key Vault.

## üê≥ Docker Support
Create a `Dockerfile` using multi-stage builds. Use Maven to build the JAR and a lightweight OpenJDK image to run the app. This reduces image size and improves container startup time. Expose port 8080 and use `ENTRYPOINT` with `java -jar`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Cloud Infrastructure
Deploy your app using **Azure Container Apps** for scalable, serverless containers. Expose the APIs through **Azure API Management (APIM)** to control access and monitor usage. Place **Azure Front Door** in front of APIM for global load balancing and HTTPS termination. Add **Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for security filtering. Use **Azure Key Vault** to store sensitive data (e.g., DB credentials, tokens), and access it securely with **Managed Identity** to avoid static secrets.

## üß™ Testing Best Practices
Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration testing and `@WebMvcTest` for controller layer testing. Use `Mockito` for unit testing services and mappers. Test layers independently: controllers (unit/integration), services (unit), repositories (integration with H2), and mappers (unit). Maintain good test coverage and avoid over-mocking.

## üß∞ Additional Best Practices
Use `@Valid` with DTOs and validation annotations to validate incoming requests. Use `Pageable` for pagination and filtering. Document your APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger (`springdoc-openapi-ui`). Return responses consistently with `ResponseEntity<T>`. Use `application.yml` for external configuration and create profiles for each environment (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`). Enable Spring Boot Actuator to monitor `/actuator/health`, `/metrics`, etc. Use proper logging with `SLF4J` and avoid `System.out.println`. Configure CORS properly, especially for frontend/backend integration. If exposing public APIs, add rate limiting and throttling policies. Regularly update dependencies and run security audits with OWASP Dependency Check, `npm audit` (if using frontend), or tools like Snyk. Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to keep libraries up to date.
